Of course! I'd be happy to help with your SQL query. Could you provide more details about what you're trying to do?


You said:
I habe a column called 'genres' that often returns multiple values, like
['action', 'scifi', 'comedy', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'romance']

I would like the above title to be returned as 6 rows, once with each string. here is my code, using PostgreSQL and DBeaver:

SELECT title, genres
FROM 
    "Netflix".titles;

In PostgreSQL, you can use the jsonb_array_elements_text() function to expand the elements of a JSON array into separate rows. If your genres column is 
stored as a JSON array (or JSONB), you can use this function to unnest the array into individual rows.

Assuming genres is a column of type json or jsonb, here’s how you can modify your query to return each genre as a separate row:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    title, 
    jsonb_array_elements_text(genres::jsonb) AS genre
FROM 
    "Netflix".titles;
Explanation:
genres::jsonb: This ensures that the genres column is treated as jsonb. If it’s already of type jsonb, this cast is unnecessary.
jsonb_array_elements_text(): This function expands each element of the JSON array into a separate row, and AS genre aliases each row value as genre.
If your genres column is a regular text array (e.g., VARCHAR[]), you could use the unnest() function like so:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    title, 
    unnest(genres) AS genre
FROM 
    "Netflix".titles;
This will also return one row for each genre in the array.

Let me know if your genres column is stored in a different format, and I can adjust the query!

this doesnt work, genres is a string, not a json array

Got it! Since your genres column is a string containing a list (e.g., ['action', 'scifi', 'comedy', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'romance']), 
and not an actual JSON array, you can use a combination of string functions to split the string and return each genre as a separate row.

In PostgreSQL, the regexp_split_to_table() function can be helpful for splitting the string into separate rows.

Here's how you can do it:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    title, 
    unnest(string_to_array(trim(both '[]' from genres), ', ')) AS genre
FROM 
    "Netflix".titles;

Explanation:
trim(both '[]' from genres): This removes the square brackets ([]) from the string.
string_to_array(..., ', '): This function splits the string by the delimiter , (comma followed by a space) into an array of substrings.
unnest(...): Expands the resulting array into separate rows.
This query will return each genre in its own row, with the title being repeated for each genre.

Let me know if this works for you!


You said:
much better! here is a typical response-
'drama'

could we strip out the quotes as well?

ChatGPT said:

Great to hear that it's closer to what you're looking for! To remove the quotes (i.e., the single quotes around each genre), we can use the replace() function 
to remove them after splitting the string.

Here's the updated query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    title, 
    replace(unnest(string_to_array(trim(both '[]' from genres), ', ')), '''', '') AS genre
FROM 
    "Netflix".titles;
Explanation:
replace(unnest(...), '''', ''): This removes any single quotes (') from each genre after it’s split into separate rows. Note that the single quote 
is escaped with double single quotes ('''), as that’s how PostgreSQL represents a single quote in a string literal.
Now, the genres will be returned without quotes. For example, you'll get drama instead of 'drama'.

Let me know if this works or if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!
